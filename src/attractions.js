                  After a day of adventure, retreat to cozy guesthouses or
                  luxurious resorts nestled amidst the snow. Savor steaming mugs
                  of hot chocolate or local favorites like Garhwali Thukpa and
                  Aloo Tikki, warming your soul from within. In the evenings,
                  gather around crackling fireplaces, sharing stories and
                  laughter with fellow travelers.
